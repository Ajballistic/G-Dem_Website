Stealing
No items may be stolen unless both the stealer and the stealee are [LINK]pa system|LINK|Aggressive[/LINK] or has one of these requirements:
	The item has lore on it (excluding [LINK]g-coin|LINK|G-Coin, G-Coin's derivatives[/LINK], and heads).
	The item has an non-survival enchant.
	It was a head and was just dropped by a killed player.
If the item is currently in a shop or is being traded then it may not be stolen, no matter what.

If two players are [LINK]pa system|LINK|Aggressive[/LINK] then they can [LINK]griefing|LINK|mine valuable blocks[/LINK] from each other bases.

Trading with other peoples villagers or using their farms counts as stealing!

Examples:
	Omegadestroy400 kills KingCrimson714 (who was Passive), AJBallistic then picks up the stuff and doesn't give it back, this is stealing.
	OllieBlitzz took 33 gunpowder from Pr1, this is stealing as Pr1 is server property.
	GreenJon took Jackaboi1's horse that Jackaboi1 gave Diamond Armour, this is stealing of the armour as it was put in Jackaboi1's horse's inventory.
	AJBallistic took UltraHalo's dolphin, this is not stealing as mobs can be stolen and had nothing in its inventory.
	Ollieblitzz stole a Netherite Ingot from Omegadestroy400 (who was passive), this is stealing.
	PersonA stole from PersonB's shop (both were aggressive), this is stealing as shops can't be stolen from.

Griefing
Generally go by the rule do not grief, you may grief under these circumstances:
	You fix any and all blocks broken.
	You and the person being griefed are [LINK]pa system|LINK|Aggressive[/LINK] and you are taking valuables blocks.

If you want to gather resources or build something then make sure you are not close to someones base, you also may not be inside of any of the base rings.

Note: If water or explosives (or anything else) breaks blocks because of you then that is also you griefing it!
Note: Griefs must be fixed within the hour unless there is an acceptable reason why it will take longer.

Note: Minor pranks are allowed but they must be fixed by the perpetrator if requested by the victim.

See [LINK]farms|LINK|the farms section[/LINK] for information for extra rules on farm griefing.

---
Farms
You may not use someone else's farms without the owners permission. This includes removing items from chests, picking up items, and harvesting growing blocks.

Killing animals that are required for a farm to work (excluding the last 2 animals in breeders) is counted as griefing!

Note: Raid farms and mob switches are not allowed.
Note: Should a farm cause a lot of lag, the owner will be asked to fix or remove it.

Examples:
	Ajballistic killed the dogs that were in GreenJon's breeder but there were still enough to breed new ones, this is not griefing.
	PersonA killed all of the sheep inside of PersonB's wool farm, this is griefing.
	PersonC killed every single cow inside of PersonD's cow breeder, this is griefing as there aren't enough to respawn them.

---
Spawn
Spawn is where the majority of shops are situated and is where new players spawn.
Builds at spawn [LINK]griefing|LINK|do not own any land around them[/LINK] unless you show that the land is owned, preferably do this with signs as that is most clear.
If you do not finish your build then it may be given to other players.
You also may not claim a large area at spawn and not do much too it!

The spawn beacons require a 3x3 hole which is on every 100 blocks, please make sure your builds take this into account as the beacons may go through them.

---
G-Coin
The servers official currency is in G-Coin.
It is not required that your shops utilise G-Coin but we recommend it!

G-Coin can be obtained via other players or by doing jobs.
You can find the current jobs in Job Listings chat in discord, they will tell you how to get the g-coin, the amount, expiration date, etc. There will also be a thread attached to the message for anything that requires submitting.

For players who would like to make texture packs for G-Coin, the [HYPERLINK]https://github.com/GreenJon902/G-Coin/blob/master/README.md#item-information|HYPERLINK|item information list[/HYPERLINK] is [HYPERLINK]https://github.com/GreenJon902/G-Coin/blob/master/README.md#item-information|HYPERLINK|here[/HYPERLINK]!

Seed: [INSERT SEED HERE]
Do not use the seed for X-ray perposes.

If you would like to find something then you can also ask an admin.

---
Contracts
If an agreement is made in chat that all parties agree too and acknowledge that it is a chat contract then whatever the content is must be adhered to!
Book contracts must also be adhered to if signed by all parties. (acknowledgement of contract is not required)

Contracts that did not have a date specified will expire after a month

Examples:
	If CrayonCroissant says in chat "I will not harm BBH" and Ajballistic agrees and they both say its a chat contract then CrayonCroissant cannot harm BBH until all parties release them from that!
	If Omegadestroy400 says in chat "If you give me resources, I will finish the ice boat race" to GreenJon but does not say that its a chat contract then Omegadestroy400 does not have to do anything!

Note: Take a screenshot of all chat contracts and include the agreeing of all parties so that you have proof in case of a breach of contract.

---
Modifications
The general rule of thumb with modifications is nothing that will create an unfair advantage or break / get around another rule!

Examples (Not Exhaustive):
	Not Allowed:
		Xray, Autoclickers (You can hold down a key, just no repeated clicking), Killaura, [LINK]seed|LINK|Seed Breakers[/LINK], Potion effect dampeners / removers.
	Allowed:
		Hotkeys, Freelook, Waypoints, Replay Mod (for recording, not base finding), Chestplate and Elytra switcher, Litematica (Not easy place mode).

If you don't know then please consult GreenJon!

Examples:
	Ve3loc1ty logged on with a hacked client, they did not use any hacks but this still counts as an illegal modification.
	Ve3loc1ty then used fly at spawn, it did not harm anyone but this is still illegal.
	Jackaboi1 logged on with a minimap that let them see the cave layout, this counts as xray as they could see what's on the other side of walls.

---
Game Exploits
You may not use game exploits for anything except for Bedrock breaking (and derivatives, e.g. end portal breaking), Rail and Carpet and TNT duplicating.

Examples:
	RinPlauge used bedrock patterns to find diamonds, this is exploiting game generation.
	OllieBlitzz used zombie death glitches to duplicate wooden swords, this is exploiting game bugs.
	GreenJon made a rail shop with rail duplicators which CrayonCroissant thought was illegal, CrayonCroissant was wrong because rail duplicators are allowed.
	ThatGuyJules made a tree farm with TNT duplicator, this is allowed as TNT Duplicating is not illegal.

Note: Mob switches are not allowed

---
Obtaining Non-Survival Items
Some items cannot be obtained in survival but are sill useful / cool to have, because of this there are some methods to get certain items:
	Spawn eggs can be obtained for a Netherite Ingot. (You may not put spawn eggs in spawners)
	Occasionally events will be ran with the prize of putting lore on an item of your choice.
	Items may also be lore if it would make sense to do so.
	Unobtainable maps and banners cannot be duplicated.

Note: These items may be [LINK]stealing|LINK|stolen[/LINK], even if you are [LINK]pa system|LINK|Passive[/LINK]

---
Homes, Warps and TPAs
The server has methods of quickly travelling around, for example there are warps to get to important parts of the server like spawn or the enderman farm!

There are also have homes, players each get two homes! You may not set a home at someone else's base without their permission.

You can also teleport to people with the TPA command.
Note: If someone dies and looses their stuff because you intentionally teleported them into an unsafe area without informing them beforehand then that counts as [LINK]stealing|LINK|stealing[/LINK].
Examples of TPAs:
	OllieBlitzz wants to give Omegadestroy400 something but Omegadestroy400 is over a lava lake so tells OllieBlitzz and then sends a TPA here request, OllieBlitzz then falls in the void and tries to sue Omegadestroy400 and fails as it was OllieBlitzz's fault.
	Jackaboi1 dislikes GreenJon so TPAs GreenJon into the void, GreenJon dies and looses all their stuff. Jackaboi1 was banned!

---
PA System
To allow more anarchist players to get along with more peaceful people, there is the Passive & Aggressive System.
By default all players are Passive, this means they can't [LINK]stealing|LINK|steal[/LINK] (with some exceptions).
In the rules & info discord chat, you can react to the message to become aggressive, this means you can [LINK]stealing|LINK|steal[/LINK] items from other players who are also aggressive!

If a player is un-whitelisted then they count as aggressive.

Note: Passive players can still be killed.
Note: A [LINK]teams|LINK|Teams[/LINK]'s base's PA Status is the owner of the [LINK]teams|LINK|Teams[/LINK]'s PA Status.

---
Miscellaneous
Our aim on the G-Dem SMP is to ensure fairness for all server members, but to protect against malicious players we will punish for anything that we deem a loop hole! We also need to be able to contact you so because of that, players must be in the discord and must reply to a staff member within a reasonable amount of time!
We will also punish players who are on purposely annoying / irritating or in any other way, being a nuisance!

No lying to owners about staff matters!

Pets can be killed ([LINK]griefing|LINK|unless they are required for a farm to work[/LINK])

You may also not assist someone in their punishment, they break the rules so they need to make it right!

If you want a prefex to your name, make or join a team. If you want to leave a team, an aggreement must be reached by you and the team leader. Team bases' [LINK]PA status|LINK|PA System[/LINK] is the same as the team leaders status.

Certain builds are owned by the server, this includes:
	Punishment Road 1 (PR1), Punishment Road 2 (PR2), Court, The Spawn Beacons, The Torture Stations, The End Farm (EF), Forever Road (FR) and Greater Forever Road (GFR)
